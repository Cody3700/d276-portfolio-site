          <p>Dear <mark>Hiring Manager</mark>,</p>
  
          <p>
            I am writing to express my strong interest in the <strong>Software Engineering position</strong> at your organization. With a diverse background in <span>UX/UI design</span>, delivery logistics, and customer experience, I bring a unique and adaptable skillset. I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at WGU and have completed a UX/UI certification through UC Berkeley Extension.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            My experiences at companies like <em>Eaze</em> and <em>Whole Foods</em> have developed my strengths in problem-solving, cross-team collaboration, and technical troubleshooting. I am passionate about creating intuitive digital experiences and am especially proud of my recent project, <em>Riparian</em>, which combines storytelling, psychology, and interactive design.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            I would love the opportunity to bring my energy, adaptability, and technical focus to your team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you further.
          </p>
  
          <p>Sincerely,<br><strong>Cody Beale</strong></p>
