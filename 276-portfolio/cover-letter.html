              <p>Dear <mark>Hiring Manager</mark>,</p>
  
              <p>
                  I am excited to submit my application for the <strong>Software Engineer/UX Designer</strong> position at <strong>your organization</strong>. As a passionate and adaptable professional with a background in both software engineering and user experience design, I am confident that my unique skill set would contribute to creating user-centered, scalable, and impactful solutions at your company.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  I recently graduated with a degree in Software Engineering from <strong>WGU</strong> and completed a UX Design certification through <strong>UC Berkeley Extension</strong>. During my academic journey, I gained hands-on experience working on projects that fused development and design, including building web applications and designing interactive user interfaces with a focus on accessibility and user engagement.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  One project that stands out is my work on <em>workplace management</em>, where I was tasked with designing a responsive web application for <span>Esteemed</span>. I collaborated with a team of developers to ensure the user interface not only adhered to modern design principles but was also optimized for functionality and performance. This experience reinforced my ability to communicate effectively across disciplines and provided valuable insights into balancing user needs with technical requirements.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  In my internship at <em>Amazon</em>, I further honed my skills in both front-end development and user research. I conducted usability testing, gathered user feedback, and worked closely with senior developers to iterate on designs based on real user data. This experience has made me particularly adept at creating intuitive, user-friendly designs while ensuring the underlying code is clean, efficient, and scalable.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  I am excited about the opportunity to join a forward-thinking team like <strong>your organization</strong>, where I can contribute my skills in software development and UX design. Your companyâ€™s commitment to innovation and user-centered design aligns perfectly with my values, and I am eager to bring my passion and creativity to your projects.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                  Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experiences can contribute to the continued success of <strong>your organization</strong>. Please feel free to contact me at <span>(916)206-1985</span> or via email at <span>codybealeux@gmail.com</span>.
              </p>
  
              <p>Sincerely,<br><strong>Cody Beale</strong></p>
